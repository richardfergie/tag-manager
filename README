A simple tag manager written using Warp (Haskell) and Redis.

Install using cabal install.

Run jsserver to start the server

The following javascript will work as the container tag:

<script type="text/javascript">
          (function() {
		var script = document.createElement('script');
                script.type = 'text/javascript';
                script.async = true;
		script.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https:' : 'http:') + '//HOSTURL/CLIENTID';
                var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
                s.parentNode.insertBefore(script, s);
          })();
</script>

The HOSTURL is the domain on which the server is running
The CLIENTID is an identifier for the site on which the container tag is placed

Quite difficult to add and administer tags at the moment; see Redis/Tags.hs for the data structure.

I may add a web frontend to make updating tags simpler but the launch of Google Tag Manager has kind of taken the wind out of my sales with this.
